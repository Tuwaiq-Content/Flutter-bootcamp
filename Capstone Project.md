# Capstone Project Template for Flutter Bootcamp

## Assignment

Welcome to the capstone project phase of the Flutter Bootcamp! This capstone project will be the culmination of your learning journey, where you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills in Flutter Development to build a real-world mobile application. The project will challenge you to showcase your proficiency in Dart and Flutter and demonstrate your ability to create user-friendly and efficient mobile applications.

## Project Description

The capstone project is an exciting opportunity for you to design and develop a real-world mobile application using the Flutter framework. You have the freedom to choose any app idea that interests you, be it a social networking app, productivity tool, educational platform, e-commerce solution, health tracker, or anything else that demonstrates your creativity and technical abilities.

Your project should address a specific problem, provide value to its users, or explore innovative ideas in the mobile app domain. Throughout the development process, focus on creating a polished and user-friendly application with a compelling user interface.

## Rules & Guidelines

1. **Group Work:** You and your group members are expected to work collaboratively on the capstone project. Each group member should contribute to the project, and collaboration among group members is encouraged to deliver a well-rounded and polished application.

2. **Original Work**: Your project should be an original creation. Do not copy or reuse code from previous bootcamp assignments, external sources, or open-source projects. The capstone project is a showcase of your learning progress and creativity.

3. **Version Control (Git)**: Create a Git repository for your capstone project. Commit frequently with descriptive messages to show your progress throughout the development.

4. **Clean Code**: Write code that is clear, well-organized, and follows standard coding conventions. Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability. Maintain a consistent coding style across the project. Consider implementing the Clean Architecture principles to organize your codebase, separating concerns into different layers (e.g., presentation, domain, data) for better maintainability and scalability.

5. **Academic Integrity**: Ensure you adhere to academic integrity principles, avoiding plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration.

6. **Learning References**: We encourage you to be self-learning and creative, and to use other learning resources to enhance your understanding and implementation. However, implement your own solutions independently and avoid copying or reusing code from external sources.

## Schedule & Deadlines

- Project Start Date: [Start Date]
- Project Submission Deadline: [Submission Deadline]

The capstone project duration is [Number] weeks, and you are expected to manage your time effectively to complete the project within the given timeframe.

## Minimum Requirements

Your capstone project should meet the following minimum requirements:

1. **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile application using Flutter framework, supporting Android and iOS platforms.

2. **User Interface (UI)**: Implement an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. Focus on user experience and ensure the app is user-friendly.

3. **Functionality**: Implement core features and functionalities relevant to your chosen app idea.

4. **Clean Architecture:** Organize your codebase following the principles of Clean Architecture, separating concerns into different layers (e.g., presentation, domain, data) for better maintainability and scalability.
 
5. **Bloc Pattern:** Implement the Bloc pattern for state management in your application. Utilize Bloc, Cubit, BlocProvider, BlocBuilder, and BlocListener to handle the application's business logic and state changes.

6. **Navigation**: Implement proper navigation between different screens and components of the application.

7. **Data Handling**: Implement data handling and storage mechanisms as required by your application.

8. **Database**: Build & use a database from `Supabase`.

9. **Documentation**: Include a README.md file in your project repository with clear instructions on how to run, test, and use the application.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your capstone project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Completeness**: The extent to which your project meets the minimum requirements.

2. **Quality**: The overall quality of your code, including clean code practices and UI/UX design.

3. **Innovation**: The creativity and originality demonstrated in your project idea and implementation.

4. **Functionality**: The successful implementation of the core features and user interactions.

5. **Documentation**: The clarity and completeness of your project's README.md file.

Remember, this is an opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity, so feel free to explore innovative ideas and push your limits in creating a remarkable Flutter application!

Good luck with your capstone project, and feel free to seek guidance from the bootcamp instructors if needed!
